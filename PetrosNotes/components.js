// React applications are entirely made out of components.
// Building blocks of user interfaces in Reacts.
// Piece of ui that has its own data, logic and appearance.
// We build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them.
// Components can be reused, nested inside each other and pass data between them (props).

// Component tree (Term to analyze complex UIs by noticing parent components and child components)

// Creating and Reusing a component
