// -> Setting up a new react project

// 1) Create-react-app

// Complete starter kit for react applications -> Everything is already configured
// Cons -> It was developed years ago so it is kinda outdated. (Not for real-world app ONLY for learning)

// 2) VITE

// Perfect for real-world apps

// Modern build tool that contains a template for setting up react applications
// Manually set up ESLint (and others).
// Extremely fast hot module replacement (Fast reload on code changes)
